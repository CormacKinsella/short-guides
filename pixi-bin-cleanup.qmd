# Pixi bin cleanup

- The pixi package manager currently lacks cleanup of the bin directory when you delete an env, which can lead to a lot of dead scripts in the bin directory.

- This script will loop through all files in the bin directory and check if the script is executable and has a corresponding binary in the env directory. If the binary does not exist, the script will be removed.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through each file in the bin directory

for file in *; do
  # Check if the file is a regular file and executable
  if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -x "$file" ]; then
    # Extract the target binary path from the script
    target_binary=$(grep -Eo '"/.*/bin/[^"]+"' "$file" | tr -d '"')
    # Check if the target binary exists
    if [ -e "$target_binary" ]; then
      echo "Binary exists for script: $file"
    else
      # Remove the script with the non-existent binary
      echo "Removing script with non-existent binary: $file"
      rm "$file"
    fi
  fi
done
```
